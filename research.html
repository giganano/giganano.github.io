				What is the assembly history of the Milky Way?

				What are the relative yields of different elements from stars
				and supernovae?
				<br><br>
				I am broadly interesting in galaxy evolution and the origin of
				the elements.
				Galactic chemical evolution (GCE) bridges the gap between
				nuclear physics and astrophysics by combining galactic
				processes like star formation with nucleosynthetic yields from
				stellar evolution models to estimate enrichment rates and
				elemental abundances in the interstellar medium (ISM).
				By studying the chemical compositions of stars, we can
				understand both the evolutionary histories of their host
				galaxies and the stellar evolution processes that shaped their
				nucleosynthetic yields.

			<div class="section-content">
				The simplest models of galactic chemical evolution (GCE)
				are called "one-zone" models, which assume instantaneous
				mixing in the interstellar medium (ISM).
				Due to their small sizes, turbulent velocities, and inefficient
				star formation, this approximation likely applies best to
				dwarf galaxies.
				<br><br>
				This figure shows a fit of one of these models to
				the <em>Gaia</em>-Sausage Enceladus (GSE), a disrupted dwarf
				galaxy in the inner stalo halo of the Milky Way.
				GSE exhibits the behavior of a "classic" chemical evolution
				model, where the [&alpha;/Fe] ratio decreases with
				increasing [Fe/H].
				This work follows a novel, statistically rigorous star-by-star
				fitting method, the details of which can be found in

				In any starburst scenario, the principle observational

				The details contain information on the timing and strength of

				The assembly history of the Milky Way is a topic of debate, so

					<h3>What it is</h3>
					VICE is an open-source GCE modeling software that I
					created.
					Many evolutionary parameters, such as the galaxy's star
					formation history, are arbitrary, user-defined functions.
					Best described as a "one size fits all" GCE software,
					this implementation allows users to explore highly complex
					parameterizations.
					VICE also provides a variety of nucleosynthetic yield
					tables from stellar evolution studies to explore.
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="column border">
				<div class="section-content">
					<h3>Why to use it</h3>
					VICE is a python package written in C, allowing it to
					enjoy both the powerful computing speeds of a compiled
					language and the ease of use of python.
					In keeping with its mantra of flexibility, users may
					construct their own expressions for nucleosynthetic yields
					independent of stellar evolution models.
					VICE users also enjoy excellent support provided by a team
					of developers!

				Despite how important they are for GCE models, nucleosynthetic
				yields are poorly understood.
				Nitrogen is one particularly difficult element to accurately
				model, because it is highly sensitive to uncertain details
				of stellar evolution models, such as rotational mixing.
				In <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022arXiv220204666J/abstract"
					target="_blank">Johnson et al. (2022a)</a>, I used my GCE
				models of the Milky Way to constrain nitrogen yields from
				stellar populations, finding that their metallicity dependence
				must be approximately linear with Z in order to explain the
				correlation between nitrogen and oxygen abundances (see Figure).
				I am collaborating with OSU students on addressing similar
				questions for carbon and helium, and plan to investigate
				additional elements in the future.

			<div class="section-content">
				If all galaxies were the same, then each galaxy would produce
				similar numbers of supernovae.
				Instead, low stellar mass galaxies have higher specific Type Ia
				supernova (SN Ia) rates than more massive galaxies
				(scaling as ~M<SUP>-0.3</SUP>, shallow black dashed line in the
				figure).
				Low mass galaxies are empirically known to host lower
				metallicity stellar populations, and the close binary fraction
				increases toward low metal abundances as well.
				In <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022arXiv221001818J/abstract" target="_blank">
				Johnson, Kochanek & Stanek (2022)</a>, we found that this leads
				to a natural explanation of the observations, suggesting that
				the elevated SN Ia rates arise due to a higher binary fraction
				as a consequence of the low metallicities of dwarf galaxies.

			<div class="section-content">
				As an undergraduate, I studied the origins of halo spin
				assembly bias, which refers to the result from cosmological
				N-body simulations that high spin dark matter halos at fixed
				mass tend to be found in denser environments than their low
				spin counterparts.
				In collaboration with <a
					href="https://www.citytech.cuny.edu/faculty/AMaller"
					target="_blank">Ari Maller</a> and
				<a
					href="https://www.nsf.gov/staff/staff_bio.jsp?lan=aberlind&org=MPS&from_org=MPS"
					target="_blank">Andreas Berlind</a>, who was a faculty
				member at <a href="https://as.vanderbilt.edu/physics-astronomy/"
					target="_blank">Vanderbilt University</a> at the time, we
				found that similar mass halos in close proximity to one another
				tend to have slightly higher spin due to perturbations from the
				local tidal field (see Figure).
				In <a
					href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019MNRAS.486.1156J/abstract"
					target="_blank">Johnson et al. (2019)</a>, we demonstrate
				that this "twin bias" accounts for the majority of the effect.
				Though the correlation between halo spin and twin distance is
				subtle, twin halos have a substantial effect on statistical
				measurements of spatial clustering.
