				The Big Bang produced only hydrogen, helium, and trace amounts
				of lithium.
				Everything else - from the carbon in our cells and the oxygen
				we breathe to the silicon in our computers and the iron in our
				infrastructure - was synthesized in stars through the nuclear
				reactions they facilitate.
				This is what Carl Sagan meant in his famous quote
				<em>"We are made of star-stuff."</em>
				<br><br>
				My research sits at the intersection of astrophysics and
				nuclear physics, seeking to understand which nuclear reactions
				occur when, where, and under what astrophysical conditions.
				By their very nature, the nuclear reactions powering stars and
				occurring in the wake of supernovae change the chemical
				composition of the material.
				This material is ultimately expelled as gas back to the host
				galaxy's interstellar medium, where it can be incorporated into
				the next generation of stars and planets that will condense out
				of the gas.

				Being the sites of star formation and supernovae in the
				universe, galaxies are like petri dishes of their own nuclear
				reactions, retaining the nuclear products that come out of
				their own stars.
				By studying the present-day chemical content of the stars and
				gas within galaxies, we can learn about the history of nuclear
				reactions that gave it such a composition.
				This graphic, produced by my colleague and advisor
				<a href="https://astronomy.osu.edu/people/johnson.3064"
				target="_blank"> Jennifer Johnson</a>, illustrates which
				elements are produced by which astronomical phenomena and in
				what relative amounts.
				<br><br>
				The majority of this work sits in a field called
				<em>Galactic Archaeology</em>, which studies this very
				connection between a galaxy's evolutionary history and its
				present-day chemical composition with particular interest in
				our home galaxy - the Milky Way.
				Revolutionary big-data surveys such as
				<a href="https://www.sdss.org/dr12/irspec/" target="_blank">
				APOGEE</a> and
				<a href="https://www.galah-survey.org/" target="_blank">
				GALAH</a> have collected and continue to collect spectra for
				millions of stars, and by combining these spectra with models
				for stellar atmospheres, we can estimate their chemical
				compositions.
				Other surveys such as
				<a href="https://www.sdss.org/surveys/manga/" target="_blank">
				MaNGA</a> collect similar data for external galaxies.
				By comparing galactic evolutionary models which track nuclear
				processes to data such as these, we can deepen our
				understanding of physics on both galactic and nuclear scales.

				Recently, I expanded my research efforts beyond galactic
				archaeology to the supernovae themselves.
				In this endeavor, I'm collaborating with Ohio State's
				revolutionary
				<a href="https://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/asassn/index.shtml"
					target="_blank">All Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae</a>
				(ASAS-SN).
				In particular, I'm taking a statistical approach to study the
				thermonuclear detonations of white dwarf stars (type Ia
				supernovae), which are known to produce a significant portion
				of the iron, nickel, and zinc in the universe.
				Relative to their mass, these supernovae are known to occur
				more frequently in low-mass star-forming galaxies
				(e.g. <a
					href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005A%26A...433..807M/abstract"
					target="_blank">Mannucci et al. 2005</a>;
				<a
					href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019MNRAS.484.3785B/abstract"
					target="_blank">Brown et al. 2019</a>).
				The origin of this result is, however, something of a mystery.
				Galaxies of different stellar masses are known to have
				different star formation histories (e.g. <a
					href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019MNRAS.488.3143B/abstract"
					target="_blank">Behroozi et al. 2019</a>), but can this
				explain the whole effect?
				Low mass galaxies are also known to have a lower metal content
				than higher mass galaxies (e.g. <a
					href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013ApJ...765..140A/abstract"
					target="_blank">Andrews & Martini 2013</a>), and the
				occurrence of binary star systems is known to increase at low
				metallicities (e.g. <a
					href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018ApJ...854..147B/abstract"
					target="_blank">Badenes et al. 2018</a>; <a
					href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...875...61M/abstract"
					target="_blank">Moe, Kratter & Badenes 2019</a>).
				Believed to arise from binary star systems, this means that low
				metallicity environments, and consequently low mass galaxies,
				should have more white dwarf supernova progenitors.
				Does this also play a role in explaining the observed supernova
				rates? Stay tuned for the results!

				VICE is an open-source galactic chemical evolution software.
				A python package with a backend written in C, VICE enjoys the
				powerful computing speeds of a compiled language while
				retaining the scientific flexibility and ease-of-use of python.
				Best described as a "one-size fits all" software library for
				this purpose, it can handle most chemical evolution models
				without any modifications to its source code.
				<br><br>
				Many evolutionary parameters typically built into these models
				(e.g. a galaxy's star formation history) are recognized by VICE
				as arbitrary, user-defined functions of time, allowing
				exploration of highly complex parameter spaces.
				In keeping with this model, VICE also allows users to declare
				their own nucleosynthetic yields directly, independent of
				previous studies in the literature; it will also calculate
				these yields upon request to assist in this process.
				<br><br>
				In March 2020, we published updates to VICE that extend its
				features to multi-zone chemical evolution models.
				In keeping with its model of flexibility, users may specify the
				mixing processes affecting both gas and stars in their models
				by telling it directly how much gas is moving between pairs of
				zones and which zone each individual stellar population is in
				at a given time.
				In this way, users can construct their own mixing processes for
				their models and let VICE handle the rest.

					This autumn, I teamed up with several of my graduate school
					classmates at <a href="https://astronomy.osu.edu/"
						target="_blank">The Ohio State University Department of
					Astronomy</a> to run this bootcamp for the incoming
					first-year PhD students.
					We are modifying the curriculum somewhat, tailoring it
					toward students who simply have a little more experience
					with python and are ready for some more advanced
					techniques.
					This time, we're planning on also covering the usage of
					<a href="https://www.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>
					and how to use <a href="https://cython.org/"
						target="_blank">Cython</a> to call external code
					written in C.
					<br><br>
					Although the participants thus far have mostly been
					senior undergraduate and first-year PhD students, the
					target audience includes <em>all</em> researchers with a
					working knowledge of functional programming who are looking
					to take their python skills to the next level.
					In practice, this could be a scientists at <em>any</em>
					career stage, even a senior faculty member!

					Advising
				</div>
				<div>
					Since the summer of 2022, I've had the pleasure of advising
					an ambitious undergraduate research student at Ohio State,
					Daniel Boyea. Daniel has been using galactic chemical
					evolution models for the Milky Way to "reverse engineer"
					the nucleosynthetic yields of carbon from massive stars
					and asymptotic giant branch stars to offer empirical
					constraints on how carbon is synthesized.
					This project is asking many of the same questions and using
					similar models as my <a
						href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022arXiv220204666J/abstract"
						target="_blank">recent paper on nitrogen
						nucleosynthesis</a>, but for carbon.
					Stay tuned for his paper!

					Undergraduate Courses
				</div>
				I have also been heavily involved in undergraduate instruction
				at Ohio State.
				Over the course of my Ph.D., I served as a graduate teaching
				assistant for five sections of <em>Astronomy 1101: From Planets
				to Cosmos</em> across four semesters as well as one semester
				each of <em>Astronomy 1142: Black Holes</em>,
				<em>Astronomy 1221: Astronomy Data Analysis</em>,
				and <em>Astronomy 1140: Planets and the Solar System</em>.

				Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion
			</div>
			Cultural minorities are poorly represented in physics and astronomy
			programs due to their historic exclusion from education and a lack
			of recruitment efforts.
			Quality mentorship at the undergraduate level has been shown to
			improve the retention of these students.
			Systematic investigations of possible remedies also recommend
			developing a science identity, self-efficacy, and sense of
			belonging.
			Additionally, I am a regular participant in Ohio State Astronomy's
			<em><a
				href="https://astronomy.osu.edu/talks/diversity-journal-club"
				target="_blank">Diversity Journal Club</a></em>, a recurring
			meeting within our department where we discuss the issues of
			diversity, equity, and inclusion not only in astronomy and
			astrophysics, but in academia as a whole.
			These seminars also dedicate discussion to our own department,
			focusing on steps we can take to improve the current situation
			facing under-represented minorities.
			Academics at all career stages are welcome, from undergraduate
			students up to tenured faculty members, and partipcation from
			early career scientists is especially encouraged.

				In the spring of 2022, I joined the leadership committee of <a
					href="https://physics.osu.edu/student-organizations-0/polaris-0"
					target="_blank">Polaris</a>, an entirely graduate and
				undergraduate student led organization which strives to improve the
				retention of students from underrepresented and non-traditional
				backgrounds in the Physics and Astronomy departments at Ohio State.
				To this end, Polaris focuses on fostering a sense of belonging,
				developing a science identity, and improving self-efficacy among
				our mentees. There are two major components to Polaris's endeavors:
				<ul>
					<li>
					</li>
					<br>
					<li>
						The <em>Polaris Mentorship Course</em> is offered to
						students navigating their first two years of Ohio State
						math, physics, and astronomy. This course first and
						foremost discusses the status of diversity in STEM and the
						advantages and disadvantages that students of different
						backgrounds bring to the field. Students are also paired
						with graduate and upper-level undergraduate student mentors
						who will help them learn how to maintain a mentor-mentee
						relationship, develop goals, communicate effectively, and
						harness mentorship as a pathway toward academic excellence.
						In each class meeting, mentors work with their mentees to
						help them achieve the goals they've set for themselves.

				The <em>Undergraduate Residential Summer Access (URSA)</em>
				program is a two-week long program that takes place every
				summer immediately before the beginning of the fall
				semester. Offered to incoming first-year and transfer
				students, URSA focuses on the nature of science and
				research, dealing with problems often faced by students
				making the transition to university-level academics, and
				how diversity and equity might impact their experience as a
				rising student in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering,
				and Mathematics). URSA also introduces students to various
				topics of research happening at Ohio State. This year, I
				served as an <em>academic facilitator</em> for URSA,
				meaning that I had the pleasure of teaching these bright
				students about my research and life as a scientist.

				Outreach
			</div>
			Upon arriving at Ohio State, I became involved with the <a
				href="https://astronomy.osu.edu/outreach/fosaa" 
				target="_blank"
			>Friends of Ohio State Astronomy and Astrophysics (FOSAA)</a>
			outreach effort.
			These events consist of a handful of Ohio State astronomers
			providing presentations on their area of research to interested
			members of the public, followed by a lunch involving the same
			audience and many more of our colleagues.
			This affords the attendees the opportunity to sit down with our
			local experts and ask their burning questions about our place in
			the universe.
			<br><br>
			As a German speaker, I was previously featured on
			<a

				target="_blank"
			>Real Scientists DE</a>, the German version of the
			<a href="http://realscientists.org/" target="_blank">Real
			Scientists</a> blog.
			In addition to the blog entry itself, this involved a week of
			interacting with their followers on their
			<a
